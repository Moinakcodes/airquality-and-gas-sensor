#  ESP-AirEcoSystem: Wireless Air Monitoring Eco-System using ESP32

ESP-AirEco is a scalable, real-time air monitoring eco-system built using two ESP32 development boards. The system monitors **LPG (via MQ6)**, **air quality (via MQ135)**, **temperature & humidity (via DHT22)**. It uses **ESP-NOW** for low-power wireless communication and **Blynk IoT Cloud** for mobile notifications and data visualization. A local **OLED screen** displays live environmental metrics.
